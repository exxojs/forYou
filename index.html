      <p>Hey, bab 👋 <br> <br>
        I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while, well for me it is. I’ve been doing some thinking, and I wanted to reach out to you again. 
        Our time and moments together, and of course you, hold a special place in my heart until to this day. And, I’ve come to realize how much I miss what we had. </p>
        
        <button id="openTwo" onclick="togglePink()">▶  More</button>
        <div class="pink">
          <p>  I understand that things can’t go back to the way they were, and that is what makes it special. Now, I would love to take the opportunity to talk and meet you; perhaps start again like we used to do. We have been together for so long; I wouldn't let go of that just because of shortcomings you had like not updating me. But now I don't really mind it. Being with you in person is where we truly understand each other; not in little chats.</p>
         <button id="openThree" onclick="toggleblue()"> True Love Never Fails💝</button>
         <div class="blue">
          <p>
           It’s best for you not to be with who I am at that time. That’s why I left; I have nothing to offer you. <br> <br>

           After that, I built myself again and learned new things that I can create to be more for you. Just like this one; After that night, I pursued this career in programming. Imagine the endless possiblities of what I can make for you with this :> <br> 
          </p>
          <p>
           I believe I did enough to be worthy of you now. So, this time, will you be the one to give another chance? <br>
          </p>

        <p>Forget about the shit that we've been through <br>
          I wanna stay here forever and always <br>

        <p>Maybe I was too optimistic <br>
        
          Maybe because our chemistry felt like quantum physics. <br> <br>
          If this is the end I need one more visit <br><br>
          
          chat me a `no` so I would know <br> <br>
          Thank you for everything, and I thought you would still be waiting. <br> <br>
          Sorry for wasting your time reading this.
